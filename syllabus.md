## Required Textbook

**Linear Algebra**, by Jim Hefferon, <https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra/>

This book is available as a free PDF and also on paper (not free, but inexpensive).





## Grading


### Components of course grade

Grades will be determined based on two midterm exams, a non-cumulative final exam,
and homework.
Weights will be as follows:

| ---
| Category | Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| Midterm 1 | 20% |
| Midterm 2 | 20% |
| Final Exam | 20% |
| Homework | 15% |
| Quizzes | 15% |
| Presentations | 10% |
| ---



### Midterm and final exams

Midterm exams will be take-home exams,
due in the 5th and 9th weeks on Thursday.
The final exam will have both a take-home component
and also an "in-class" component.

| ---
| Exam | Due Date |
| :--- | :--- |
| Midterm 1 | 2/11/21 |
| Midterm 2 | 3/11/21 |
| Final (take-home) | 5/4/21 |
| Final (in-class) | 5/5/21 (12:00 p.m.-2:00 p.m.) |
| ---



### Homework

You are encouraged to work collaboratively on homework.


### Quizzes

Short quizzes will be every 1--2 weeks.


### Presentations

Students will make group presentations of a chosen topic.
The list of topics will be from sections of the textbook that aren't covered in class;
each group will choose what topic they want to present.
The groups will have 5 students,
who work together to make a 5 minute video presentation about their topic.
The first presentation will be due in week 7 (February 22-26)
and the second presentation will be due in week 14 (April 19-23).


### Online work

Submissions and grading for homework, quizzes, and take-home exams will be paperless,
using WeBWorK and/or GradeScope.




## Help

### Allowed resources
For homework assignments, you are encouraged (in fact, expected)
to collaborate with your classmates and to ask me questions.
Other resources (books, online sources, people outside the class) are highly recommended
for clarifying class topics or for enrichment
(but *not* for getting solutions to problems).

You are allowed to use things that you learn from a book, online source,
or person outside the class
that *help you and your classmates to find your own solution* for a problem.
However, if you read a full solution, so that there's little or nothing left for you
and your classmates to figure out,
then you *may not turn in that solution for credit*.


### Helpful Websites

The Mathematics Stack Exchange (<https://math.stackexchange.com>)
is a very useful question-and-answer site for undergraduate/graduate level mathematics.
You are welcome to browse the Mathematics Stack Exchange and even post questions there.
Hopefully it will help you learn and understand the material!
However please remember that if you use that site to get a solution to a problem,
then you can't turn that solution in for credit.

Other helpful websites for basic information include Wikipedia
and MathWorld (<http://mathworld.wolfram.com>).


### University Resources

Boise State University's [The Basics](https://www.boisestate.edu/student-life/basics/)
web page has links to many forms of support,
ranging from academic resources to family, living, and food resources.

The Graduate College has
[many resources for graduate students](https://www.boisestate.edu/graduatecollege/current-students/)
such as GradWell,
the Graduate Student Success Center, and Graduate Writing Consultations,
as wells as forms, deadlines, and graduation information for graduate students.

Boise State University's
[Writing Center](https://www.boisestate.edu/writingcenter/)
may be helpful.

You may reach out to me at any time if there's anything I can help with
or if there's anything you think I should know.
