## My WebWork quiz score is zero, why is that?

The quiz was converted into a homework so that students can open it and see the questions
after the due date, for practice purposes.
At the same time, the point values were reset to 0.
Before that was done, the scores were recorded and downloaded.
They haven't been lost.


## Why do WebWork quizzes show up twice in the assignment list?

WebWork quizzes are set up with one link that creates (or "spawns") an instance of the quiz,
with particular random numbers and so on.
This is called a "version", so you will create and take "version 1" of the quiz.
You have two links, one to create versions of the quiz,
and one to actually take your version 1 of the quiz.
The one that counts for credit is actually taking the version of the quiz.

If you're curious, the reason is that WebWork quizzes were originally designed as
gateway quizzes, which you could take multiple times until you passed.
For example, in a calculus class, there could be a "differentiation gateway"
where you have to get at least 6 out of 7 derivatives right,
and you can try once a day until you pass.

In our class we're not using that feature, the retakes.
Instead, the quizzes are capped at one version.

WebWork wasn't originally designed to be used for "regular" quizzes,
but in this pandemic we're just working with what's available.
