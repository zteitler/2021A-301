## My WebWork quiz score is zero, why is that?

The quiz was converted into a homework so that students can open it and see the questions
after the due date, for practice purposes.
At the same time, the point values were reset to 0.
Before that was done, the scores were recorded and downloaded.
They haven't been lost.
